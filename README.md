User flow (MVP): 

login -> landing screen displays which stocks you're following (scollable sidebar) -> when on a stock you can see price data

at price data you can set a price pin -> pin is considered to be a buy or sell order -> displays graph of all expenditure net +/- and calculates your monetary standing if you were to set a pin at n price point

it really bothers me that its so hard to track what I bought at and what I sold at in a visually intuitive way so I can understand my net gains/losses and buy on dips more strategically??
